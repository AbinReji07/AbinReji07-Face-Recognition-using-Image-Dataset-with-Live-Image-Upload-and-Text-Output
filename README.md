# AbinReji07-Face-Recognition-using-Image-Dataset-with-Live-Image-Upload-and-Text-Output
This project trains a face recognition model using an image dataset. Each person has a folder of face images. When a new image is uploaded, the system compares it with the trained data, recognizes the face, and outputs the matched person's name as text. Built using OpenCV and the face\_recognition library.
